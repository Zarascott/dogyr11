                <h2>Bella's Story</h2>
                <p>Bella, a sweet Labrador mix, was found in a scary drug house. She was really skinny and scared, but her big, sad eyes grabbed everyone's attention. After being rescued, she was taken to the SPCA, where she’s been getting lots of care. Even though her past was rough, Bella is super friendly and loving. Now, she’s waiting for a new home where she can get all the cuddles and playtime she deserves. Bella’s ready for a fresh start with a loving family.</p>
                <h2>Things Bella's Likes</h2>
                <p>Bella enjoys playing fetch and taking long walks. She likes travelling to different areas and interacting with new people. Her favourite thing to do is curl up for cuddles. Bella enjoys chewing on her favourite toys and tanning in the sun..</p>
                <h2>Things Bella’s Doesn't Like</h2>
                <p>Bella becomes anxious around loud noises and abrupt movements, thus she dislikes them. She dislikes spending a lot of time alone herself. Bella detests thunderstorms as well and would rather keep dry than go near the water. She doesn't like stranger dogs at first, but she warms up to them eventually..</p>
